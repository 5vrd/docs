## Inactivity

If for some reason Bender left your server for no reason or automatically, it could be for these reasons:

The server was inactive for a long time and was automatically left (nothing will happen; you'll just have to invite him back).

## Blacklisted

If for some reason your server was blacklisted for violating the Terms of Service, this could be the reason why your server was automatically left. Please read the rules for both Bender and Discord. If you want to request to be removed from the blacklist, please contact support at [support server](https://discord.gg/nqpXt4Yx).
